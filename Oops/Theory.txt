1. What is Class ?

It is a Userdefine Blueprint that help to create Object. It define the common function or 
properties that can be used by multiple Objects . It always starts with a Capital letter.

For example :

A Car is a Class. It have some common properties like Color , Model , Brand , Speed etc.
And some common functions like Start() , Stop() , Accelerate() , Brake() etc.
So , we can create multiple Objects from the Car Class like Audi , Swift , Creata etc
which are from diffrent brand but shares same properties .
Each Object will have its own properties and can use the common functions defined in the Class.


So in Short , Class is a Template of an object , and object is the  Instance / Real Thing of a Class.


2. What is Object ?

It is an Instance of a Class. It is created from the Class and have its own properties and
can use the functions defined in the Class.

For example :

Car is a Class.
Audi is an Object of Car Class.
Swift is another Object of Car Class.
Each Object will have its own properties like Color , Model , Brand , Speed etc.
And can use the common functions like Start() , Stop() , Accelerate() , Brake() etc.
So in Short , Object is the Real Thing / Instance of a Class.
